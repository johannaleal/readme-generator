# ReadMe Generator

## Description

In this project, I have created a command-line application to generate a README file. The application will dynamically generate a professional ReadMe.md file from a userâ€™s input using the Inquirer package. The user will be presented with various prompts whose data will be used to populate the sections of the ReadMe file. Some of these sections will be validated including the project title, project description, and email address.
